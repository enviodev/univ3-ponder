# The entity types defined below map to database tables.
# The functions you write as event handlers inside the `src/` directory are responsible for creating and updating records in those tables.
# Your schema will be more flexible and powerful if it accurately models the logical relationships in your application's domain.
# Visit the [documentation](https://ponder.sh/guides/design-your-schema) or the [`examples/`](https://github.com/0xOlias/ponder/tree/main/examples) directory for further guidance on designing your schema.
